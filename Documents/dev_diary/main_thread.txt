How does it run:

int main(int argc,char*argv[])
    For Windows platform main is actually an alias for _mangled_main and is being called
    from inside allegro lib (allegro\platform\alwin.h); what about other platforms?

    - platform driver is created
    - command line parsed
    - some shit going on :)
    - either initialize_engine() or initialize_engine_with_exception_handling() is being called
    
    
int initialize_engine_with_exception_handling(int argc,char*argv[])

    - does some extra stuff
    - calls initialize_engine()


int initialize_engine(int argc,char*argv[])

    - read config
    - displays setup if this is what has to be done; platform->RunSetup(); then exits
    - getting game data file (.exe or .dat)
    - init fonts
    - init mouse
    - memory check
    - init voice pack
    - init audio vox
    - init keyboard
    - some extra setup
    - init sound
    - init pathfinder
    - loads game data
    - exits here if running just for (un)registering game
    - disk space check
    - setup resolution
    - init gfx filters
    - switching to graphics mode
    - more unspeakable tweaking :)
    - calls initialize_start_and_play_game()
    - waits for it to exit, then quits
    
    
void initialize_start_and_play_game(int override_start_room, const char *loadSaveGameOnStartup)

    - starts recording here if needed
    - loads saved game if needed; calls do_game_load for that
    - otherwise call start_game();
    - main loop: calling main_game_loop() every tick
    
    
void start_game()

    - runs game_start script
    - loads and inits first room
    
    
int main_game_loop()

    - calls mainloop(true)
    - does some tweaking to gui
    
    
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
void mainloop(bool checkControls, IDriverDependantBitmap *extraBitmap, int extraX, int extraY)

    - polls mp3 or something like that
    - checks for exit flag and exits if desired
    - checks scripts for some reason
    - if in the room, run_function_on_non_blocking_thread()
    - check_new_room ()
    - checks for player exiting room
    - checks debug keys
    - checks controls
    - animates animated buttons
    - update_polled_stuff_and_crossfade()
    - render_graphics()
    - update_events()
    - update_polled_stuff_if_runtime()
    - changes background frames if needed
    - updates sound volume
    - starts replay record here if that's what was wanted
    - returns here if fast-forwarding
    - polls stuff even more once
