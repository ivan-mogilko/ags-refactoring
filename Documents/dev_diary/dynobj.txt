There is a bunch of paired types with one unit of a pair being a struct
Script*something and another being struct CC*something, a child of
struct AGSCCDynamicObject.

In other word, we may say there's a pair of DynamicObject and ScriptObject.

Example: *AudioClip, *AudioChannel.

On other hand there are types called Script*something that are derived from
AGSCCDynamicObject on their own.

Example: ScriptViewFrame, ScriptDynamicSprite

Why such composition and how it works?

//=============================================================================

In the 'pair' cases DynamicObject gets ScriptObject as a parameter for
serialization.
So, we may speak of 'Dynamic' part and 'Script' part. They may be joined
in one class, or separated.
'Dynamic' part provides methods for serialization, runtime type check and
memory management.
'Script' part contains some actual data, such as Id, reference to game object, etc.

For example,
struct CCGUI : AGSCCDynamicObject   - dynamic part
struct ScriptGUI                    - script part
struct GUIMain                      - game object referenced by ScriptGUI.

//=============================================================================

It is interesting, that ne instance of dynamic object may be used to manage number
of script objects.
Check:
    ccRegisterManagedObject(&scrHotspot[ee], &ccDynamicHotspot);
    
    
//=============================================================================

Script objects are used in connection with script execution.
It looks like dynamic objects (or parts) are for memory management/serialization only.

Management is processed by ManagedObjectPool class. Items are stored as ManagedObject
type.
ManagedObject holds:
- handle (id?);
- address of actual data (script object);
- dynamic object, that is responsible for referencing script object;
- reference count.

//=============================================================================

Question is: will it be possible to make one base class/one class per type system
for dynamic/script object?
What about game objects, will it be possible to merge them with dynamic ones?
